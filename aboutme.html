		<h1> About Me</h1>
		<p> Hello to all, and welcome to my Art Portfolio. I am super excited for<br> all of you to learn more about me and my journey. From a young age,<br> I have always loved to draw. My parents can vouch with the probably<br> hundreds of white paper I took from their printer. It was a passion of<br> mine and just something I was good at. I don't draw daily like I used to,<br> and I don't consider myself to be the best at it. However, that doesn't<br> not make me an artist. I believe that everyone is an artist in some way.<br> Having the skill to paint or draw isn't just what makes you an artist, but<br> rather your ability to create does. Art is beautiful and can tell a life story.<br> The essence of life is art. </p>

		<h1>What Is This For? </h1>
		<img src="images/iu.png">
		<p> I enjoy drawing and wanted to share some of my artworks.<br> However, that isn't the only reason I made this portfolio. I<br> also really enjoy coding, and wanted more experience/practice<br> doing so. Therefore, making an art portfolio was the perfect<br> way to get the experience I've been talking about. </p>
