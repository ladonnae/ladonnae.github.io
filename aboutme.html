		<h1><i>About Me</i></h1>
		<p> Hello to all, and welcome to my Art Portfolio. I am super excited for<br> all of you to learn more about me and my journey. From a young age,<br> I have always loved to draw. My parents can vouch with the (probably<br> hundreds) of white paper I took from their printer. It was a passion of<br> mine and just something I was good at. I don't draw daily like I used<br> to, and I don't consider myself to be the best at it. However, that doesn't<br> not make me an artist. I believe that everyone is an artist in some way.<br> Having the skill to paint or draw isn't just what makes you an artist, but<br> rather your ability to create does. Art is beautiful and can tell a life story.<br> The essence of life is art. </p>

		<p><p> I am an undergraduate student at Indiana University, studying Informatics<br> with a cognate in Fine Arts and a soon minor in Computer Science. I plan<br> to expand my technical skills and knowledge to achieve technological<br> innovation and solve world problems.</p>

	<div class="why">
		<h1><i>What Is This For?</i></h1>
		<img src="images/iu.png">
		<p> I enjoy drawing and wanted to share some of my artwork<br> with the world. However, that isn't the only reason I made<br> this portfolio. I also really enjoy coding, and wanted more<br> experience/practice doing so. Therefore, making an art port-<br>folio was the perfect way to get the experience I've been<br> wanting. I am also hoping that this might inspire someone<br> who might be contemplating whether they are good or not<br> good enough at art. I want someone to look at my work and<br> not compare theirs to mine, but rather see it as a push to keep<br> going and trying.</p>

		<h1><i>My Art Background And Style</i></h1>
		<p>Even though I've been drawing as a child, I haven't always been taking it seriously. I wasn't<br> serious until around 2014/2015. When I first started to draw it was just from my imagination.<br> Though when I actually wanted to learn something, I would pick a picture and attempt to draw<br> it from observation. I went from drawing features, to faces, to full on people. Then I would<br> expand and start practicing animals. I then went on to create an instagram page just for my art,<br> and take suggestions for what I should draw in the future. Drawing is something that I would do<br> off and on over the few years, but is also something that I will never give up on. Even though my<br> career path is not directly involving art, there are a lot of things that I have learned and can bring<br> with me on my journey. I try to use creativity with everything I do in hope of creating change.</p>

		<h1><i>Fun Facts</i></h1>
		<p>I have a lot of things that I like to do outside of drawing. I enjoy watching movies and reading<br> books occasionally. I am apart of a book club where a couple of us get together to read a book<br> every other month (It's quite relaxing). One fact you should know about me is that I LOVE the<br> Lion King and I know just about every line from the movie. Also, I really really love food and<br> enjoy traveling, which is something I plan on doing more often. </p>
